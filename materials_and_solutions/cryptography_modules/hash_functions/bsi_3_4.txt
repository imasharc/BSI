Kali commands useful for completing tasks from BSI:
TOPIC: [CRYPTOGRAPHY] Hash functions

task_1: The MD5 hash function
nc -v IP PORT (display details about the connection to IP on PORT)
...
(one-liner returning the string to be encoded from the server)
nc IP PORT | grep -o '".*"' | tr -d '"' | tr -d '\n' (From the nc command output, find string that matches a given regex and trim the '"' (quotation) and the newline characters from it)

(one-liner to md5 hash the string (to be encoded) which was received from netcat)
nc IP PORT | grep -o '".*"' | tr -d '"' | tr -d '\n' | md5sum | tr -d '\s*-' | tr -d '\n' (similar as abover but at to the pipe md5 hashing, spaces, '-' and newline characters trimming)

task_2: The SHA1 hash function
(similarly as above but change md5sum to sha1sum)
nc IP PORT | grep -o '".*"' | tr -d '"' | tr -d '\n' | sha1sum | tr -d '\s*-' | tr -d '\n'

task_3: The SHA3 hash function
nc IP PORT | grep -o '".*"' | tr -d '"' | tr -d '\n' (to get the string)
vim sha3_encode.py
python3 script:
    import hashlib
    
    sha3 = hashlib.sha3_512()
    sha3.update('STRING'.encode('utf-8'))
    print(sha3.digest())
python3 sha3_encode.py

task_4: Breaking the MD5 hash with the dictionary method
echo "txt" > pass.txt (write "txt" into the pass.txt file)
wc file.txt (word count)
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt pass.txt (make John the Ripper read word from worldist.txt)
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --format=raw-md5 pass.txt (make john read thee wordlist.txt and hint it with the format of hash function used)

task_5: 
Hash function identification
python script

task_6: The HMAC authentication code
SHA512 vs HMAC -> HMAC uses key to guarantee data integration
man openssl
man openssl dgst
openssl list --digest-commands
echo -n 'FILE' | openssl dgst -sha512 -hmac 'KEY'

task_7: MD5 collision
nc IP PORT < file.txt (redirect file content for the input 'on the fly' for netcat connectionS)
